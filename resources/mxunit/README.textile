h2. About this repository

The main distribution branch is currently located at http://mxunit.googlecode.com/svn/mxunit/trunk/ (Subversion)

The presence of the MXUnit source at here Github does not indicate that MXUnit is _moving_ from Google Code to Github. This repository is at Github to help distribute MXUnit to as many people as possible (like those who prefer Git), and to work on MXUnit 2.0 in a collaborative Git environment. Please feel free to fork and hack.
